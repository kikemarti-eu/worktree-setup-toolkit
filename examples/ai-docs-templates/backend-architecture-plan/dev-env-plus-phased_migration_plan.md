- **Implement enhanced architecture** with centralized configuration and migration system
- **Maintain production stability** throughout migration process
- **Minimize development disruption** with strategic feature freeze

## üìä **Migration Strategy Overview**

```
Current State: PROD only ‚Üí DEV Setup ‚Üí Architecture Migration ‚Üí Enhanced PROD
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì           ‚Üì                ‚Üì
  Single env    Dual env    New arch in DEV   New arch in PROD
```

## üóìÔ∏è **Implementation Phases**

### **Phase 1: DEV Environment Setup**
**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Risk Level**: üü¢ Low  
**Parallel Work**: Yes (no production impact)

#### Objectives
- Create isolated development environment
- Validate DEV environment functionality
- Enable safe testing without production risk

#### Tasks
```bash
# 1. Create DEV project in Appwrite Console

# 2. Clone PROD configuration
cp environments/appwrite.prod.json environments/appwrite.dev.json
sed -i 's/quixotictools/quixotictools-dev/g' environments/appwrite.dev.json

# 3. Deploy to DEV
appwrite deploy --config environments/appwrite.dev.json

# 4. Configure DEV-specific variables
MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB: "10" (vs 25 in PROD)
DEFAULT_USER_CREDITS: "50.0" (vs 10.0 in PROD)
CLEANUP_AFTER_HOURS: "6" (vs 1 in PROD)
```

#### Success Criteria
